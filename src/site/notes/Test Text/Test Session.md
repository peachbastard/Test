# Events

>[!recap]
>Last game began with our party investigating the bear-man that they had thoroughly defeated in battle. Ryn cast Speak with Dead to reanimate the corpse and extract more information from it and confirmed that he was a werebear that previously refused entry to the village of Sunshire due to his condition. Corpse in-bag, they set out to return to the village and cash in on their bounty and get more questions answered.
>
>The rain began to pour along the way, and the party decided to take shelter in a nearby cave to let Archibald recover from his Exhaustion. As he rested, a voice reached out to Tiberius, telling him to question everything that comes ahead.
>
>Meanwhile, Isil dreamed of himself running through pink sakura trees, chasing after his Black Dagger. The dagger embedded itself into the trunks of one of the trees. Though he tried with all his might, he was not able to pull the dagger from the tree. 
>
>The party returned to the Sunshire Hunting Guild and were rewarded handsomely with 4000 GP and a pair of Boots of Elvenkind. The party spent an hour within the Hunter's Guild as Tiberius incorporated the boots into his armor. As they waited, the din of activity came to a whisper as a refined looking man crossed the threshold.
>
>Tiberius immediately used his preliminary research to identify the man as Mayor Ajit Kervatz, leader of the small village. He introduced himself and invited the party to his manor for dinner and to stay the night. 
>
>Ajit left to attend to urgent paperwork while they waited for dinner to be served. Curious, Isil used his Invisibility spell to trail behind the man undetected. To his dismay, the young elf found himself trapped alone with the mayor in his bedroom with nothing but paperwork about lumber acquisition to report back about. 
>
>As this happened, the rest of the party searched the library for something to satiate their suspicions about the mayor. Tiberius found himself engrossed in a book he found in low gothic regarding how to avoid becoming your own grandfather and other paradoxes; while the rest of the party searched for books pertaining to their own personal goals and questions and were unsuccessful. 
>
>We ended the session with Ryn reading *The Gentleman Thief* to a delighted Isil. We pick back up in the library with the party investigating the manor for answers to their questions.
